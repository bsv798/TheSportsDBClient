      "strDescriptionEN": "Chelsea put in another staunch defensive display to draw 0-0 with Arsenal and take another step closer to sealing the Premier League title.\r\nGeorge Graham, from his perch in the stand, would in his own way have loved it. Not seeing Arsenal fail to overcome Chelsea, of course. Just the manner in which the opponents executed their game plan.\r\nChelsea didn’t need to win here. They just didn’t want to lose. So, after half-time, Jose Mourinho threw a big blue blanket over the action in the way that Graham did, on occasions, in his time at Arsenal. Some of those players were still living off those lessons years later, when Arsene Wenger won the Double with them.\r\nUntil Mourinho gave the order to shut it down, the match had been highly entertaining. A few opportunities at either end, the standard smattering of vain penalty appeals. Everyone ticked off with referee Michael Oliver, both teams looking capable of victory.",
